Bandgap Reference Circuit
Overview
This project focuses on designing a Bandgap Reference (BGR) Circuit, a crucial component in analog and mixed-signal circuits that provides a stable voltage reference independent of temperature, supply variations, and process variations. The circuit is designed to generate a reference voltage close to 1.2V, leveraging the temperature-dependent characteristics of silicon junctions.

Features
✔️ Temperature-Independent Voltage Reference
✔️ Low Power Consumption
✔️ Process and Supply Voltage Variation Resilience
✔️ Designed for CMOS Technology
✔️ Optimized for Stability and Accuracy

Design Methodology
The bandgap reference circuit is based on the principle of compensating the temperature coefficient of a PN junction voltage (which decreases with temperature) using a proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) voltage generated by a resistor network. The final output is achieved by summing these two voltages to obtain a stable reference.

Key design steps include:

Choosing Transistor and Resistor Ratios: To balance PTAT and complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) voltages.

Operational Amplifier Integration: To stabilize and regulate the circuit.

CMOS Layout Optimization: To reduce mismatch and improve performance.

Temperature and Monte Carlo Simulations: To verify circuit performance under different conditions.
